# How to apply dimension reduction unsupervised technique using R

This project is special as it is the first repo I've posted showcasing my work using R instead of python. 

The algorithms are of high quality in spite of the fact that I learnt R under 2 weeks

The projects datasets are retail based consumer purchasing patterns. I've used unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA and T-SNE to get the most important features for my model.

I used K means and Hierarchical models to perform the learning.
